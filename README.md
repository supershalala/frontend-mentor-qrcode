## Overview

Hello World this is my first project on frontend mentor. I have just started studying full-stack web development and wanted to test my skills that i have learnt from the first 2 weeks of class. I found this project quite challenging as i'm still trying to wrap my head around certain concepts particularyly flex-box and how to properly align what i want on the page.

Thanks for reading

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Learnt how to make a card using flex-box. Learnt alot about flex-box and how it interacts with the page. 

```html
        <img  src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code - Scan Me!">

```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .card {
    background-color: rgb(252, 252, 252);
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: column nowrap;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    width: 275px;
    height: 425px;
    box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px lightgrey;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 20px;
    border-radius: 25px;
}
}
```

```


### Continued development

Flex-box and mobile first development. This project was designed on a desktop and the mobile component was not thought about until after.
